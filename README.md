# RHGD
This code accompanies the paper "Hamiltonian Descent Algorithms for Optimization: Accelerated Rates via Randomized Integration Time".

To reproduce the results:
1. Open code_of_experiments.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the cell order to reproduce all figures in Section 5.
3. The notebook uses only standard Python libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib).
4. Reproducing Figures in Appendix H requires manually setting parameters such as the condition number (kappa), smoothness constant (L), stepsize (eta), or regularization constant (Î±), as noted in the corresponding code cells.

No external data, model checkpoints, or confidential info included.
